# CS-255

The client for this project was the DriverPass team. The intent was to design a system that would allow customers to register for their drivers' training program online through a web-based system. This system would enable the entire process of signing up for drivers' training to be completed in one place, from registration, purchasing a training package, planning appointments, accessing learning materials, and finally, if the package included them, accessing online tests.

My most effective part of this project was identifying requirements for the system to function based on the interview performed with the DriverPass team.

I would revise my work on the various UML diagrams used in this project to ensure I was more confident in the level of detail included in them.

The DriverPass team's needs were pretty simple overall with basic design concepts of how the system should be constructed. To implement their needs, I ensured the diagrams covered the basic functions they were looking for, while respecting their desire for strong security and admin management of the system by ensuring actions were logged and could be reviewed if issues were to occur in the system. When designing, user needs may extend beyond the basic function of the system, so it is essential to consider the specifications of what they want their system to look like when designing it.

I treat designing like I would treat writing a research paper. I start by identifying requirements for the project and any other user needs that go beyond base function. After that is done I determine how best to incorporate each of these requirements and move forward from their with designing diagrams.
